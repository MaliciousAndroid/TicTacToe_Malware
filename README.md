# TicTacToe_Malware
We will develop a malicious game (MalGame) based on a tic tac toe game. The malicious game will be able to delete contact list from a mobile phone. Instead of it just going through and deleting once, the MalGame would run a background service on the phone and periodically delete the contact list every a few minutes. The MalGame only runs after the next boot.
