## Project Desctiprion
I have developed a malicious game (MalGame) based on a tic tac toe game. The malicious game delete all the contacts from an android mobile phone when run. Instead of just deleting the contacts once, the malicious tictactoe game would runas a background service, everytime the phone reboots and would delete the entire contact list on every reboot.

## Dependencies
This project has been built in Android Studio, using Gradle configurations. Latest version of Android Studio can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

## Installation
For installation, you just need to download/clone this repository.

## Tutorial
Refer to the TicTacToe_Malware [wiki](https://github.com/shivenchawla/TicTacToe_Malware/wiki) for tutorial on creating the malicious tictactoe game.
