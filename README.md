# TicTacToe_Malware
I have developed a malicious game (MalGame) based on a tic tac toe game. The malicious game will be able to delete contact list from a mobile phone. Instead of it just going through and deleting once, the MalGame would run a background service on the phone and periodically delete the contact list on every reboot. The MalGame only runs after the next boot.

A simple tic tac toe program was obtained from open source here:
